To do in A7
Add authentication

- in menu and a drop down for sign-up, Sign-in, Log-out,

Create the following components:
    Sign up
    Sign In
    Household
    Roomie


 Authentication should:
    Sign up allows user access to one or more houses in separate instances
        -- You must sign out of one to enter another
    Should be able to create a new house
        -- you are now admin
    join an existing house



  Questions to answer:
    How to allocate chores across users when n-users != n-chores



Each user gets a unique key. That key is the name of of an object in Firebase.
That object holds the names of the different data endpoints for chores, house, etc.
OR
It holds the names of the houses they are in.
Then each house has its own set of data fields.

Should I start a whole new project and begin with authentication?
  - maybe not. I can build an authentication module.

Map of Use
New user is taken to sign up page
user signs up and either joins a Household or creates a new one.
Once signed up user is taken to a Household page which shows the members of the Household

From there they can naviate to the supplies, chores, or admin/account components


When a new house is created there are no chores or supplies. The user must add them.



Terms:

House: a house consists of: chores and supplies
Household: a group of users accessing the same house
User: a member of a household


A7 - Project Plan
Build with authentication and limited chore & supply.
The only C&S functions will be to create them. Display will be limited to a simple list of each together on one page.
A8 will integrate A6 & A7
A7 will be able to log in a user, create houses/households, create chores & supplies
A7 will demonstrate ability to have multiple users using multiple instances of the app
Example: Purple House and Casa Corazones will each be able to have their own 'instance'
